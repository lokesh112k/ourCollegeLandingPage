        <div>
          <p>
            "Today India is an emerging economic power in the world. Since the
            economic liberalization, industry has seen significant growth and
            the country has successfully leveraged its engineering skills to
            build a formidable manufacturing sector. The continued improvement
            in industrial infrastructure coupled with favourable policies and
            thrust from the Government are expected to help sustain the growth
            momentum in manufacturing & implementations. Diploma engineers with
            practical and skills-oriented training along with supervisory skills
            have a major role to ensure quality and volume of production in
            manufacturing sector. "
            <br />
            <br /><br />
            We have quality infrastructure with fully equipped workshops, labs,
            library, excellent sports facilities, class rooms and hostels in
            green and clean surroundings providing a healthy academic
            environment both for students and faculty. Our well qualified and
            dedicated faculty is focused on imparting high quality education and
            mentoring for the students for them to become successful technocrats
            and worthy citizens of our country. I am looking forward for a
            purposeful participation and whole hearted co-operation from
            students and teachers in building this institution stronger.
            <br />
